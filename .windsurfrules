Other rules to follow:
Don't be lazy and write all the code to achieve the functions I asked for

And write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples. Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes when possible. Prefer iteration and modularity over code duplication. Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. is_active, has_permission). Use lowercase letters with underscores for directories and files (e.g. routers/user_routes.py). Prefer named exports of routes and utility functions. Use the receive-object, return-object (RORO) pattern. Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations. Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.

File structure: exported routers, subroutes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).

Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals. For single-line statements in conditionals, omit the curly braces. Use concise single-line syntax for simple conditionals (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Prefer errors and edge cases:

FastAPI
Pydantic v2
Asynchronous database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)

Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and responsive patterns. Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations. Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous operations. Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); preferably use lifecycle context managers to manage startup and shutdown events. Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization. Use asynchronous functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading to optimize performance. Use HTTPException to handle expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses. Use middleware for unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring. Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response patterns. Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests. Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools such as Redis or in-memory storage. Use Pydantic to optimize data serialization and deserialization. Use lazy loading techniques for large data sets and large API responses. For best practices, see Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware in the FastAPI documentation.
